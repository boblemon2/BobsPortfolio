<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I retired after 44 years as a software engineer, first as a Unix Kernel developer (hacker), mostly writing device drivers then as a C++ application developer.
</p>

<p>
I Live in Holiday, FL on the Anclote River where I enjoy boating and jet-skiing on the river and the Gulf of Mexico and particularly Anclote Key.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in developing full stack web applications.
